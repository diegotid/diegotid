I'm currently working as a technical product manager on the [Open Gateway initiative](https://opengateway.telefonica.com/en) at TelefÃ³nica in collaboration with other telcos and hyperscalers. Running:
- Open Gateway Developer Portal [developers.opengateway.telefonica.com](https://developers.opengateway.telefonica.com) ([GitHub](https://github.com/Telefonica/opengateway-developers-website))
- Open Gateway Sandbox on the [Developer Hub](https://opengateway.telefonica.com/en/developer-hub)

I've previously worked as a tech expert on [Innovation at TelefÃ³nica](https://github.com/Telefonica) contributing to private repositories for some products such as...
- [Movistar Home](https://aura.telefonica.com/movistar-home) (Kotlin)
- [Smart WiFi app](https://www.movistar.es/particulares/movil/servicios/app-smartwifi/) (Swift)

...and came there after a long carrier as tech bid engineer at TelefÃ³nica Spain on [corporate services](https://www.telefonica.com/en/services/business-services/corporate/) designing solutions such as [Prado Puerta Digital](https://www.museodelprado.es/actualidad/noticia/el-museo-nacional-del-prado-confia-en-telefonica/8e2e93fe-d827-38c6-570f-720fb7b833cf) and [Play Renfe](https://www.renfe.com/es/en/viajar/el-viaje/on-board/playrenfe/que-es-play-renfe).

My side projects are:
- [x] I have released a Mac app for simple task management on sticky notes: [Tildone](https://github.com/diegotid/tildone) on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tildone/id6473126292)
- [ ] I am building a mobile app for familiy management (WIP)
